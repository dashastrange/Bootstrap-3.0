    <h3>Some nice quotes</h3>
    Stuff your eyes with wonder, he said, live as if you'd drop dead in ten seconds. See the world. It's more fantastic than any dream made or paid for in factories.
Living at risk is jumping off the cliff and building your wings on the way down.
You don't have to burn books to destroy a culture. Just get people to stop reading them.
Don't think. Thinking is the enemy of creativity. It's self-conscious, and anything self-conscious is lousy. You can't try to do things. You simply must do things.
We are cups, constantly and quietly being filled. The trick is, knowing how to tip ourselves over and let the beautiful stuff out.
Jump, and you will find out how to unfold your wings as you fall.
You must stay drunk on writing so reality cannot destroy you.
We are an impossibility in an impossible universe.
If you hide your ignorance, no one will hit you, and you'll never learn.
I don't try to describe the future. I try to prevent it.
